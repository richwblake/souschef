# Souschef

Welcome to Souschef, your kitchen assistant. It will provide recipes and helpful information for over 200 different dishes.
You are free to search recipes various ways, such as by name or by the category of the dish.
Please see below for details on installing and executing this gem on you local machine.

## Installation

Unfortunately, this gem as it stands now cannot be published to rubygems. This is because there is an existing gem
with this name, and I do not want to take the time to configure it to do so.\n\nYou may fork and clone the repository
where this gem is located by means of either SSH (recommended) or HTTP.

First, fork the repository by clicking the 'fork' button in the top right corner of the screen

## Usage

The app will open and prompt you for a way to search for a dish. Follow the prompts to search using the way you have chosen.


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
